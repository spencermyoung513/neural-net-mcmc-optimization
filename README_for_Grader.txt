This is just a quick summary of the repository for grading. There are 3 main parts to the project and they can be navigated by using the following. 1. For Univariate Regression, go to UnivariateLinearRegression/ folder, these notebooks should not be dependent on other files. The individual notebooks represent different Experiements. 2. For Multivariate Linear Regression on the California Dataset, this can be accessed through housing_linear_regression.ipynb which is dependent on the .py files included. The .py files where the main architecture for our algorithm and are self-explanatory for the most part. 3. The Neural Network experiements are all found under a name NetworkMNIST-*.ipynb. There are multiple notebooks that contain various experiements that we wanted to record. These notebooks are dependent on on the .py files as well. The file called experiements.py also expidites the entire process and is the highest level that we put together. This program can run multiple experiments. In addition, we have the Gradient Trained Neural network contained in 522NNGradMNIST.ipynb.
